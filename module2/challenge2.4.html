            <li>Add Waterleaf and Periwinkle: Once the meat is cooked, add the waterleaf and periwinkle to the pot. Stir and allow them to cook until the waterleaf releases its juices.</li>
            <li>Add Crayfish and Pepper: Add the ground crayfish and pepper to the mixture. Stir well and cook for a few minutes to blend the flavors.</li>
            <li>Add Afang Leaf and Red Oil: Finally, add the Afang leaf and pour in a generous amount of red oil. Stir everything together, cover, and let it simmer for 5-10 minutes on low heat. Adjust seasoning to taste.</li>
